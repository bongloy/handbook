# Employment Basics
In this section, we expalin our employee contract types and define our basic employment policies.

## Employmnet contract types
Full-time employees work at least 30 hours per week or 130 hours per month on average.

Part-time employees are those who work fewer than 30 hours per week.

Full-time and partime employees can have either temporary or indefinite duration contracts.  Full-time employees under an inddefinite duration contract are entitled to our company's full benefits package.

## Equal Opportunity employment
Bongloy is an equal opportunity employer.  We don't tolerate discrimination against proected characteristics (gender, agex, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ethnicity, regligion, disability). We want all employees (including executivies and HR) to treat others with respect and professionalism. In practice, this means that we:

* Hire and promote people based on skills, experience or potential and try to reduce bias in every process (e.g. through stuctured interviews.)

## Recruitment and selection process
Our hiring steps might vary across roles, but we always aim for a process that is fair and effective in hiring great people. If you are hiring for an open role, you will likely go through these steps:

1. Identify the need for a new job opening.
2. Decide whether to hire externally or internally.
3. Review job descriptions and write a job ad.
4. Get approval for your job ad.
5. Select appropriate sources (external or internal) to post your job opening.
6. Decide on hiring stages and possible timeframes.
7. Review resumes in our company database.
8. Source passive candidates.
9. Shortlist applicants.
10. Screen and interview candidates.
11. Run background checks and check references.
12. Select the most suitable candidate.
13. Make an official offer.

Steps may overlap, so skip steps when appropriate. Each member of a hiring team might have different responsibilities (e.g. recruiters source and hiring managers interview candidates.)

Throughout this process, we aim to keep candidates informed, communicate well with each other and give everyone an equal opportunity to work with us. Ask our recruiters for help whenever you need to enhance candidate experience or write an inclusive job description.

## Background checks
If you want to run background checks on candidates, ask HR for guidance. This process is sensitive and we must always abide by laws and ensure candidates understand our intentions. As a general rule, commission a background check for finalists only. Use our contracted provider and ensure you have your candidates’ permission.

## Attendance
We expect you to be present during your scheduled working hours. If you face an emergency that prevents you from coming to work one day, contact your manager as soon as possible. We will excuse unreported absences in cases of [*serious accidents, acute medical emergencies*.] But, whenever possible, we should know when you won’t be coming in.
